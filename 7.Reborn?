Off work at 7 pm.Until 9 clock I went to play basketball I didn't do anything valuable, except cooked a dinner.After back from basketball field I began learning English, it's totally 85 minutes. Plus the sport time and study time , it's total 2.5 hours.So form I off work to 12pm. 理论上I have 4.5 hours, minus 2.5hours,I wasted 2 hours, priceless 2hours. remember these 2hours, largely defined different people, the. excellent and the just ok. Also I notice d every time after eaten, it's always have a feeling like 秃废and lazy. Not fit to study.So I determined to sport, each time I feel wonderful, relaxed fully body and can dive into studying. Sport first, study second. Also I realized that be person is more important than be studying. it's very simple that, oh,I suddenly remembered I wrote this yesterday.
