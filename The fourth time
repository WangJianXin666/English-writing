This is the fourth time I  teach my niece english.Before teach her I always think that chirldren must hard to learn,which leads the completely result later.I found her not only learn quickly,but also working on it very hard.I begun to think that I can teach english online,not only english but the way self-taught,this is most important when I realized that I can learn everything.And soon I thought why Im understand this at this age,if I can understand at youth age ,I will not like current status.I found that many students in big cities have a better basic knowage than county students.Every time I back to   hometown I found many children take school as a task and they were playing this or that without thinking any knowageel thing.Their holidays didn't have any extra study resources,thay just 不情愿地 did some homework。And the city boys and girls,some of them are learn programming,some of them are improve mathmatics.This is huge diference,how can you imaging years later their differences between each other。In a reasonable spelucation猜想,the city chirldren will go to the best school,from middle scholl,high schill,college,universities.And most of the  county children will attend less 差一点的school or even into workforce.Few of them will have the oppotuenity to enter in the first class orgnization,like company,institude,scholarship.That's very scable things every time when I thinking。
